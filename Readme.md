* The dataset has been taken from kaggle, using kagglehub. It contains around 5,00,000 entries of data. the data contains 11 columns. The dataset is distinguishing all the transsacrtions into fraud transactions and safe transactions. The dataset is imbalanced. 
* Dataset takes into account the, transaction time and upi numbers.
* I have compared the fraud_transaction count vs safe transaction counts. Also does correlation matrix between features. 
* I have compared between hour of transaction and fraud_risk. & boxplot to find the distribution of quartets of amount for fraud_risk=1 and fraud_risk=0.
* It has seaborn heatmap plots also.
